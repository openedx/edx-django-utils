Development Workflow
--------------------

One Time Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # clone the repo
  git clone git@github.com:edx/edx-django-utils.git
  cd edx-django-utils

  # setup a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it.
  # $(basename $(pwd)) will give you the name of the current working directory, in this case ``edx-django-utils``
  mkvirtualenv -p python3 $(basename $(pwd))


Every time you develop something in this repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv.
  workon edx-django-utils

  # Grab the latest code.
  git checkout master
  git pull

  # Install the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests
  make test

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim …

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the test
  make test

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit …
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Design Pattern followed by packages
-----------------------------------

All tools in edx_django_utils should expose their public api in their __init__.py files. This entails adding to __init__.py all functions/classes/constants/objects that are intended to be used by users of library.
