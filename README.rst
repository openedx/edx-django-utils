Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is in the docs directory, and is published to https://edx-django-utils.readthedocs.org.

Getting Started with Development
--------------------------------

Please see the Open edX documentation for `guidance on Python development <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/how-tos/get-ready-for-python-dev.html>`_ in this repo.

Design Pattern followed by packages
-----------------------------------

All tools in edx_django_utils should expose their public api in their __init__.py files. This entails adding to __init__.py all functions/classes/constants/objects that are intended to be used by users of library.

Getting Help
------------

`discuss.openedx.org <https://discuss.openedx.org>`_ where you can connect with others in the
community.

Our real-time conversations are on Slack. You can request a `Slack
invitation`_, then join our `community Slack workspace`_.
