Searching New Relic
===================

The search script `new_relic_search.py`_ is generally useful for searching NRQL (New Relic Query Language) and text widgets in New Relic. It searches the NRQL in New Relic alert policies, and in NRQL and text widgets in New Relic dashboards. Use ``--help`` for more details.
